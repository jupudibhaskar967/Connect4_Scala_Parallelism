This is implementing Connect4 game using Scala Actor system.

Actor system is used to implement Parallelism.

Here in the code, number of workers denotes the number of cores and number of threads used are 7 as size of the board is 7*7.

Implemented using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

Here, in minimax the depth search space is exponential and we have used a depth of 8.

Depth indicates the difficulty of the game. More depth indicates more difficulty.

Used Actor system to induce parallelism in implementing minimax recursive algorithm.

Here the size of the board and depth are configurable.


How to Play:
scalac Play_main.scala Utility.scala
scala Play_main


Performance analysis:
This code performs the best on a system with 7 cores and with depth of 10.
